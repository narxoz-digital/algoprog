1. There are three types of repetition statements: the `while` loop, the `do-while` loop, and the `for` loop.
   > Существует три вида стэйтментов повторения: цикл `while`, цикл `do-while` и цикл `for`.
   > 
3. The part of the loop that contains the statements to be repeated is called the loop *body*.
   > Тело цикла - это стейтменты которые повторяются в цикле.
   > 
5. A one-time execution of a loop body is referred to as an *iteration* of the loop.
   > Однократное выполнение тела цикла называется *итерацией* цикла.
   > 
7. An *infinite* loop is a loop statement that executes infinitely.
   > Бесконечный* цикл - это цикл, который выполняется бесконечно.
   > 
9. In designing loops, you need to consider both the loop control structure and the loop body.
    > При проектировании циклов необходимо учитывать как структуру управления циклом, так и тело цикла.

7. The `while` loop checks the loop-continuation-condition first. If the condition is `true`, the loop body is executed; if it is `false`, the loop terminates.
8. The `do-while` loop is similar to the `while` loop, except that the `do-while` loop executes the loop body first and then checks the loop-continuation-condition to decide whether to continue or to terminate.
9. The `while` loop and the `do-while` loop often are used when the number of repetitions is not predetermined.
10. A *sentinel* value is a special value that signifies the end of the loop.
11. The for loop generally is used to execute a loop body a fixed number of times.
12. The for loop control has three parts. The first part is an initial action that often initializes a control variable. The second part, the loop-continuation-condition, determines whether the loop body is to be executed. The third part is executed after each iteration and is often used to adjust the control variable. Usually, the loop control variables are initialized and changed in the control structure.
13. The `while` loop and `for` loop are called *pretest* loops because the continuation condition is checked before the loop body is executed.
14. The `do-while` loop is called a *posttest* loop because the condition is checked after the loop body is executed.
15. Two keywords, `break` and `continue`, can be used in a loop.
16. The `break` keyword immediately ends the innermost loop, which contains the `break`.
17. The `continue` keyword only ends the current iteration.
