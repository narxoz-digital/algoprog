1. Java provides the mathematical methods sin , cos , tan , asin , acos ,
atan , toRadians ,
toDegree , exp , log , log10 , pow , sqrt , cell , floor , rint , round , min , max ,
abs , and random in the Math class for performing mathematical functions.
2. The character type char represents a single character.
3. An escape sequence consists of a backslash ( \ ) followed by a character or a combina-
tion of digits.
4. The character \ is called the escape character.
5. The characters ' ' , \t , \f , \r , and \n are known as the whitespace characters.
6. Characters can be compared based on their Unicode using the relational operators.
7. The Character class contains the methods isDigit , isLetter , isLetterOrDigit ,
isLowerCase , isUpperCase for testing whether a character is a digit, letter, lower-
case, and uppercase. It also contains the toLowerCase and toUpperCase methods for
returning a lowercase or uppercase letter.
8. A string is a sequence of characters. A string value is enclosed in matching double
quotes ( " ). A character value is enclosed in matching single quotes ( ' ).
9. Strings are objects in Java. A method that can only be invoked from a specific object is
called an instance method. A non-instance method is called a static method, which can
be invoked without using an object.
